# LassaSeq
LassaSeq is a command-line tool that simplifies the process of analyzing Lassa virus sequences. It automates the complete workflow from downloading sequences to creating phylogenetic trees, with special handling for Lassa's bi-segmented genome.

## Genome Segments
Lassa virus has a bi-segmented RNA genome consisting of:
- **L segment**: (~7.2kb) Encodes the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and Z protein
- **S segment**: (~3.4kb) Encodes the nucleoprotein (NP) and glycoprotein precursor (GPC)

## Installation

### Prerequisites
First, install conda if you haven't already:
```bash
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

Then, ensure you have the required channels:
```bash
conda config --add channels defaults
conda config --add channels bioconda
conda config --add channels conda-forge
```

### Option 1: Using Conda (Recommended)
Install [LassaSeq via Conda](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/lassaseq):
```bash
conda create -n lassaseq -c bioconda lassaseq -y
conda activate lassaseq
```

### Option 2: From Source Code
1. Create and activate a new conda environment:
   ```bash
   conda create -n lassaseq -c bioconda python=3.9 mafft trimal iqtree
   conda activate lassaseq
   ```

2. Install lassaseq:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DaanJansen94/LassaSeq.git   
   cd LassaSeq
   pip install .
   ```

3. Re-installation (when updates are available):
   ```bash
   conda activate lassaseq  # Make sure you're in the right environment
   cd LassaSeq
   git pull  # Get the latest updates from GitHub
   pip uninstall lassaseq
   pip install .
   ```
   Note: Any time you modify the code or pull updates from GitHub, you need to reinstall the package using these commands for the changes to take effect.

## Usage

First, make sure your conda environment is activated:
```bash
conda activate lassaseq

Lassaseq can be run in two modes:
1. Interactive Mode (default) - for interactive use
2. Non-Interactive Mode - for HPC submissions or automated runs

### Interactive Mode
If optional arguments are not provided, the program will run in interactive mode and prompt for choices:
```bash
lassaseq -o output_directory
```

### Command Line Mode
All options can be specified directly:
```bash
# Download complete genomes from human hosts with known location and date
lassaseq -o lassa_output --genome 1 --host 1 --metadata 3

# Download sequences with ≥80% completeness from both human and rodent hosts
lassaseq -o lassa_output --genome 2 --completeness 80 --host 3 --metadata 4

# Download sequences from specific countries and lineage
lassaseq -o lassa_output --genome 1 --host 1 --metadata 3 --countries "Sierra Leone, Guinea" --lineage IV

# Filter for different sublineages in L and S segments
lassaseq -o lassa_output --genome 1 --l_sublineage III --s_sublineage II

# Download sequences and perform phylogenetic analysis with segment-specific sublineages
lassaseq -o lassa_output --genome 1 --host 1 --metadata 3 --phylogeny --lineage IV --l_sublineage III --s_sublineage II
```

### Lineage Information
The tool includes lineage information for Lassa virus sequences in the `lineages` directory. The lineages are in line with current literature, and sublineages for lineage IV were determined using fastbaps software. Users can modify or update the lineage files (`l_lineages.txt` and `s_lineages.txt`) to include their own lineage assignments. Each file follows a tab-delimited format with columns for accession numbers, lineages, and sublineages.

### Summary File Content
The summary_Lassa.txt file provides detailed information about:
- Detailed host distribution with sequence counts for:
  - Human hosts
  - Rodent hosts (e.g., Mastomys natalensis, Hylomyscus pamfi)
  - Other hosts
  - Sequences with no host information
- Geographical distribution at each filtering step
- Final sequence counts for each segment

### Phylogenetic Analysis
When the `--phylogeny` flag is used, LassaSeq performs the following steps:
1. **Sequence Concatenation**: Combines downloaded sequences with reference and outgroup sequences, removing duplicates.
2. **Multiple Sequence Alignment**: Uses MAFFT with optimized parameters:
3. **Alignment Trimming**: Uses TrimAl with `-automated1` for automated trimming
4. **Tree Building**: Uses IQ-TREE2 with ultra-fast bootstrap and 10,000 replicates

### Tree Visualization
The phylogenetic trees generated by LassaSeq (`.treefile` files) can be visualuzed using various software packages (e.g., FigTree) and annotated using the metadata files provided by LassaSeq.

1. **Install FigTree**:
   - Download from: http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/
   - Available for Windows, Mac, and Linux

2. **Visualizing Trees**:
   - Open FigTree
   - Load the tree file (e.g., `l_trimmed.fasta.treefile` or `s_trimmed.fasta.treefile`)
   - Import the corresponding metadata file (`l_metadata.txt` or `s_metadata.txt`)
   - Use the metadata columns to color and annotate your tree:
     - Location: Country of origin (e.g., SierraLeone, Nigeria)
     - Location2: City or specific location (e.g., Kenema, Nzerekore, Unknown)
     - Host: Host species (Human, Rodent, Other)
     - Date: Collection date in decimal format (e.g., 1969.000)

## Handling Recombination Events
Due to the computationally intensive nature of recombination detection, this analysis is not included in LassaSeq itself. However, it is highly recommended to perform recombination analysis as a separate step before conducting phylogenetic analyses, as recombinant sequences can interfere with accurate tree reconstruction. Here's the recommended workflow:

1. **Recombination Analysis**:
   Before running LassaSeq's phylogenetic analysis, perform recombination detection using your preferred tool. For example, HYPHY GARD can be installed and used as follows:
   ```bash
   # Example using HYPHY GARD
   conda install bioconda::hyphy
   hyphy gard --rv Gamma --mode Faster --alignment trimmed_alignment.fasta --output gard_output.json
   ```
   Note: Recombination analysis can be time-consuming depending on your dataset size and chosen tool.
   
2. **Remove Recombinant Sequences**:
   Once you've identified recombinant sequences using your chosen analysis tool, add their accession numbers to a `remove.txt` file. Use this file with LassaSeq's `--remove` option to exclude these sequences from the analysis:
   ```bash
   lassaseq -o lassa_output --genome 1 --host 1 --metadata 3 --remove remove.txt --phylogeny
   ```

This optional but recommended step is crucial for obtaining reliable phylogenetic trees, as recombinant sequences can lead to incorrect evolutionary relationships and branch patterns.
